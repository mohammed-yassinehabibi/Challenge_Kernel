# TODO 

## Kernels 

- Find an appropriate Kernel for Nucleotide sequences.

- Adapt the gaussian kernel into an exponential kernel with optimal power p.

- Implement Local Alignment Kernel (search if it is possible, currently too computationally costly & exploding values)

## Optimizer

- Try another optimizer. Currently implemented : Newton Method
