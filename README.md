# What is in this repository?

You can find the Data Challenge Kernel Methods 2024-2025 for which this github has been created [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/data-challenge-kernel-methods-2024-2025/leaderboard).

# Implementations

## Kernels 

- Kernel for Nucleotide sequences.

## Optimizers

- Newton Method for Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR)

- SVM with Kernel Trick

# TODO

- Adapt the gaussian kernel into an exponential kernel with optimal power p.

- Implement Local Alignment Kernel (search if it is possible, currently too computationally costly & exploding values)
